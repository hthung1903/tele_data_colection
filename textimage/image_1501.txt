Data Privacy
(Encryption)

Authentication

Data Integrity

Key Management

Compatibiity in

Volnerability
Deployment in
tems of complexity

Replay aack
protection

Security is provided in con-
trast to wired networks

Rivest Cipher 4 (RCA)

\WEP-Open and WEP-Shared
crc

Key management isnot pro-
vided

Possible to deploy on current
hardware infrastructure

Vulnerable against Chopchop,
Binau's fragmentation and
DoS attacks including variety
‘of Dos attacks.

Easy to deploy and configure

[No protection against replay
attacks

Implementation of major IEEE802.1
standards with WEP without requiring
new hardware

“Temporal Key Inegrity Protocol
(TKIP)

WPA-PSK and WPA-Enterrise

Data integrity is provided through
Message Integrity Cod,

“The 4 way handshaking mechanism is
used to provide for key

management

Possible to deploy on both current and
previous hardware

Vulnerable against Chopehop,
Ohigashi Mons, WPA-PSK.
and Dos stacks

Implements sequence counter for
replay protection

‘Complete IEEE 802.1 standards
‘are implemented with new
enhancements of WPA

Authentication is provided through
chipper blocks wth CMP and
AES,
WPA2-Personal and
WPA2 enterprise
Cipher block chaining message
authentication code (CBC-MAC)
‘The 4 way handshaking
‘mechanism is used 1 provide

for key management
(Oller Network Interface Cards are
‘no supported, Only the 2006 and

‘Vulnerable against DoS attacks due
to unprotected contol frames and
MAC spoofing

\WPA.2 requires complicated setup
with WPA enterprise
Implementation of 48-bit

atagran/packet number protects
against replay attack
